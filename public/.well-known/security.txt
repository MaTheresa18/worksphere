# Guidelines for Security Researchers

## Scope
We welcome responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in our application.
Please report any issues you find to the email above.

## Rules of Engagement
1. DO NOT perform denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS) attacks against our infrastructure.
2. DO NOT access, modify, or delete user data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
3. DO NOT share vulnerability details publicly until we have had reasonable time to address the issue (minimum 90 days).
4. DO NOT use automated vulnerability scanners that generate excessive traffic.
5. Focus only on security vulnerabilities - do not report spam, phishing, or social engineering issues.

## What We Promise
1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. We will provide an estimated timeline for resolution.
3. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.
4. We will credit you in our Hall of Fame (with your permission).
5. We can provide links to your LinkedIn or portfolio as proof of your contribution.

## Out of Scope
- Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (please report those to the library maintainers)
- Issues that require physical access to user devices
- Social engineering attacks against our team members

## Thank You
We appreciate the security research community's efforts to help keep WorkSphere secure.
Your contributions help protect our users and improve our platform.
