## 2024-05-23 - SSRF in Email Configuration
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled input in `EmailAccount` configuration was used directly in `EsmtpTransport` and IMAP client, allowing connection to internal/private IPs (SSRF).
**Learning:** `empty($host)` allows "0" (string) to pass, which resolves to `0.0.0.0` (localhost), bypassing simplistic checks.
**Prevention:** Use strict checks (`$host === null || $host === ''`) and validate resolved IPs against private ranges using `filter_var`.
